# import all the things



# initalize the sensors and ports

# timing variables

# make a threshhold value for the photoresistors
thresh = 800

# from reading the sensor we get an array of ints

rawval = [934, 354, 888, 266]

# basically want to take these value, convert to a on/off and hav those numbers
# represnt "bits" so we have 16 positions
# use dictionary to define n/s/e/w
